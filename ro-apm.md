# Radiation Oncology APM: an introduction and primer to the proposed rule for practices and providers

### Introduction: what is the Radiation Oncology Alternative Payment Model?

The Radiation Oncology Alternative Payment Model (RO-APM) is an alternative payment model under which Medicare patients would be reimbursed using an episode-based payment schema rather than the current fee-for-service (FFS) schema. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services Innovation Center (CMMI) published in July 2019 a Notice of Proposed Rule Making for the RO-APM that describes details of various aspects of the proposed model [1]. The public comment period has ended, and we are currently awaiting updates regarding the final rule. 

Under the proposed rule, the RO-APM would cover 17 different cancer types and be mandated for providers randomly selected according to eligible geographic areas, with the goal of covering 40 percent of eligible radiation episodes. The objective of this current paper is to provide a detailed summary of the current proposed RO-APM rule to answer commonly raised questions, facilitate meaningful discussion, and to promote awareness and readiness among the community of radiation oncology practices and providers. We note that details may ultimately be different in the future final rule. 

### What is the history of the RO-APM?

The RO-APM can be seen as part of a larger policy effort by the CMS to test models that transition from fee-for-service payments to value-based payments. The Affordable Care Act of 2010 established the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services Innovation Center (CMMI) for the purpose of creating and piloting new value-based payment models. This effort has been further advanced by the 2015 Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act (MACRA) which instituted the Quality Payment Program (QPP), incentivizing practice participation in alternative payment models through a 5% bonus [2]. 

The CMMI has launched over 40 new payment models affecting a diverse range of medical specialties [3]. Notably, they launched the Oncology Care Model in 2016 for Medicare beneficiaries receiving chemotherapy treatment--an episode-based payments model with a focus on care coordination for medical oncology. Discussion between the CMMI and stakeholders, including ASTRO, regarding a radiation oncology-specific APM has taken place over the course of several years. ASTRO leadership has taken a proactive role in providing input for the RO-APM with the aim of achieving longer-term payment stability for the specialty as PAMPA expires in 2015 [4]. 

In July 2019, the CMMI published a proposed APM rule for radiation oncology. This is not the final formulation of the RO-APM that will be implemented in practice, but rather a proposed model with invitation for comments. ASTRO and ABS published responses to the RO-APM in September 2019 raising several significant concerns regarding the proposed model [5, 6].  The public comment period for the Notice of Proposed Rule Making has now closed, and we await updates regarding the final rule. 

### What is the timeline for the RO-APM?
The effective start date of the RO-APM is currently not known and would be published with the revised final rule. Based on the CMMI Unified Agenda, there is a 3-year limit for final action after publication of a proposed rule, meaning that at the latest the RO-APM would begin in July 2022. However, this represents the outer limit, and it is possible that the effective start date would be earlier than July 2022. 

Note that a start date of January 1, 2020 was previously proposed. However, ASTRO and other organizations voiced concern regarding the feasibility of implementing the proposed RO-APM on such short notice. This is no longer considered the start date, and the RO-APM will not take effect until a final rule has been published. The proposed duration would cover a performance period of 5 years. 

### What is the CMS rationale for the RO-APM? 

The CMMI report identifies three key reasons underlying the rationale of applying alternative payment methodology to the field of radiation oncology: 
1) Site neutrality. Currently, freestanding centers and hospital outpatient departments (HOPDs) use different payment schedules that can result in different effective reimbursement rates. The CMMI report identified higher reimbursement volume and per-episode rates in freestanding centers as compared to HOPD.
2) Shifting incentives from volume-based to value-based therapy. They cite lower rates of utilization of shorter treatment schedules such as hypofractionation in breast and single-fraction bone metastasis palliation.
3) Challenges with coding. They cite difficulty valuing services such as intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), requiring revision of code sets, as well as differences in coding systems between freestanding centers and HOPDs.  

The RO-APM would be a large-scale pilot of a model that incorporates episode-based, site-neutral payments, aiming for a net impact of three percent in savings. The CMMI estimates that the proposed RO-APM model would result in net savings of $260 million over five years. 

### Who participates in the RO-APM?

Participants within the RO-APM would be randomly selected physician group practices (PGPs), freestanding centers, or HOPDs. The proposed RO-APM rule aims to cover 40% of eligible RT episodes nationally; a simulated selection process included 616 PGPs, 325 freestanding centers, and 541 HOPDs. There is currently no known timeline for announcing the selected participants.

 Participants are identified by their Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) or CMS Certification Number (CCN) and would be classified as one of the following:
-	Professional participant: PGPs billing under Medicare PFS that furnish the professional, physician-dependent services
-	Technical participants: HOPDs or freestanding centers that deliver the technical portion of RT care
-	Dual participants: Groups where the physicians also own the facility equipment, furnishing both technical and professional components 

Participation would be mandated by geographic region, divided according to Core-Based Statistical Areas (CBSAs) defined by the Office of Management and Budget where the participant resides [7]. In other words, if the zip code of RT service delivery (as listed on claim submission to the CMS) for a participant belongs within a CBSA that was randomly selected for the RO-APM, then that provider or facility must participate. 

The following would be exempt:
-	Any participant that furnishes RT services only in Maryland, Vermont, or the U.S. Territories
-	Any facility classified as an ambulatory surgery center, critical access hospital, or Prospective Payment System-exempt hospital
-	Any participant or eligible participant for the Pennsylvania Rural Health Model. 

### What treatments would be included in the RO-APM?

Treatments where RT services are delivered in a zip code associated with a selected CBSA would be included, if they fall under one of the 17 covered cancer diagnoses or clinical scenarios as determined by ICD-9/ICD-10 codes. Table 1 shows the 17 proposed cancer types and their associated diagnosis codes. This list of cancer types was determined by the CMMI and is subject to revision on an annual basis. Medicare reimbursement for diagnoses not covered by the RO-APM would follow the current FFS reimbursement schedules. 

The majority of commonly used treatment modalities would be included under the RO-APM. This includes IMRT, stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT), stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT), image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT), brachytherapy for gynecologic and prostate cancers, and proton beam therapy (PBT). Notably, evaluation and management services are not included under RO-APM and would continue to be reimbursed FFS. “Low volume” RT services such as neutron therapy, radiopharmaceuticals, hyperthermia, and specialized brachytherapy services would also be excluded. 

Additionally, the Medicare beneficiaries are excluded if:
-	Enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans or other Medicare managed care organizations
-	Enrolled in a Programs of All-Inclusive Care for Elderly (PACE) plan
-	In a Medicare hospice benefit period

### How is the per-episode reimbursement determined?

For each episode of care, the RO-APM will reimburse separate professional and technical payments. These are paid to the according Professional, Technical, or Dual participant in the patient’s care. The proposed RO-APM rule details a pricing methodology formula with eight steps. Table 2 summarizes the steps and adjustment factors used in the reimbursement formula. We direct the reader to the proposed rule for additional reading regarding the nuances of each adjustment step. 

The final reimbursement is heavily determined by the base rate. Within each of the 17 cancer types, there is a base rate for technical and professional reimbursement. These are listed in Table 3. These base rates have been calculated by the CMMI using the historical average cost for an episode of care for each of the cancer types, divided into professional and technical reimbursements. With the base rate as a starting point, these would then undergo a series of adjustments according to the formula described above.  We note that ASTRO and other stakeholders have brought up several meaningful criticisms of the methodology used to calculate the base rates, for example the incorrect incorporation of palliative cases for some diagnoses, and the base rates in the final rule may differ significantly. 

The details of reimbursement for scenarios involving multiple physicians and sites of service, such as when one provider delivers external beam therapy and another delivers brachytherapy, are currently unclear. ABS and ASTRO have requested further clarification from CMS on this matter. 

### How are payments processed under the RO-APM? 

Figure 1 demonstrates the timeline for an episode of care under the proposed RO-APM. To summarize, an episode of care encompasses RT delivery for a specific diagnosis within the 17 covered cancer types in a 90-day period. The 90-day window begins on the day of initial treatment planning service and ends upon completion of RT. If RT is not delivered within 28 days then the episode is considered incomplete. Additionally, another episode for the same patient cannot be triggered until 28 days (the “clean period”) after the first episode ends. If additional RT services are delivered for the same diagnosis in the 90-day window without a 28-day break, these are bundled within the same episode.

Payments occur in two installments. CMS pays 50% of the professional payment and 50% of the technical payment upon the start of an episode (triggered by billing a RO model-specific code), and the remainder at the end of an episode (triggered by billing the RO model-specific code with an end-of-episode modifier). 

In the August following each performance year, the CMS performs a reconciliation process that accounts for incomplete episodes of care, calculation errors, and duplicate services. In later performance years, the quality payments to Professional participants and patient experience payments to Technical participants are also determined at this time. Additionally, another “true-up” process to calculate any additional reconciliatory payments would take place annually, one year after the initial reconciliation.  Note that portions of each payment are withheld: 2% for incorrect payments, 2% for quality payments, and 1% for patient experience payments. The withheld payments are then reconciled and paid after the annual reconciliation process. 

### How is the quality component of the payment determined and reported?

The portion paid out of the initial 2% quality withhold would be calculated based on an Aggregate Quality Score (AQS) for Professional and Dual participants. The proposed AQS places 50% weight on quality measures and 50% weight on reporting required clinical data elements.

Quality measures will be scored on a scale from 1-to-10. Professional and dual participants will be expected to report aggregated quality measure data based on all treated patients (not limited to Medicare beneficiaries). This quality measure data would be inputted through a secure portal provided by the CMS, to be submitted annually by March 31st following each performance year. 

There are four proposed quality measures summarized here and in Table 4.
1.	Plan of care for pain. Measures the percentage of patients with moderate or severe pain with a documented plan to address pain within their first two visits.
2.	Screening for depression and follow-up. Measures the percentage of patients screened for depression using a standardized tool with a documented plan for follow-up care. 
3.	Advance care plan. Measures the percentage of patients age 65+ with either a documentation of discussion about advance care plan, or a documented advance care plan / surrogate decision maker. 
4.	Treatment summary communication. Measures the percentage of patients who have a treatment summary report sent to the physician providing continuing care and to the patient within one month of treatment completion. This would be scored as pay-for-report in performance years 1-2 and pay-for-performance in performance years 3-5. 

### What clinical data elements are expected to be reported?

In terms of reporting clinical data elements, the CMS proposes to collect clinical information including cancer stage, disease involvement, treatment intent and specific treatment plan information at the patient level. The precise variables to be reported are not yet known. The current proposal is to collect this information for all patients, not limited to those treated under the Medicare RO-APM. For the CMS, these data would be used to support analysis, develop accurate pricing, and develop new quality measures. CMS plans to create a set of reporting standards and collaborate with EHR vendors to facilitate submission of these measures through a secure portal. A maximum score for reporting is achieved with data submission for ≥95% of eligible beneficiaries. 

### How is the patient experience component of the payment determined?

The payment from the initial 1% patient experience withhold for Technical and Dual participants would be determined based on results from the Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) Cancer Care Survey [8]. The survey would be administered starting in performance year 1 by a CMS-approved third party contractor. The results of the survey would be incorporated into payments starting in performance year 3.

### How do participants qualify for the 5% APM incentive payment?

The CMS aims for the RO-APM to meet criteria for both Advanced and MIPS APM programs. These are the proposed requirements under the radiation oncology model:
-	Discuss goals of care and treatment intent (curative vs palliative) for each patient
-	Document adherence to guidelines or rationale for deviating from guidelines for each patient
-	Assess TNM staging and performance status for each patient
-	Send a treatment summary to the referring physician within 3 months of the end of treatment
-	Perform and document peer review on treatment plans within 2 weeks of treatment start and before 25 percent of the total prescribed dose is delivered, or preferably before starting treatment. 
-	Attest/certify participation in a radiation oncology-specific patient safety organization (PSO) and attest/certify use of certified electronic health record technology (CEHRT)

### What are additional administrative requirements for practices under the RO-APM? 

In addition to the previously described quality metrics and clinical date elements to be reported, the proposed rule describes several administrative requirements for practices. These are not finalized but it may be useful for practices to be aware of this information. To briefly summarize:
-	CMS will generate a list of physician practitioners and submit them to qualifying Dual and Professional participants, to be certified by the participant within 30 days
-	Maintain records of each beneficiary for a potential audit for at least six years from the last payment determination or audit for that beneficiary
-	Each beneficiary covered under RO-APM must be delivered a standardized written notice during their treatment planning session, to be developed by CMS
-	Any publicly-released document that references or relates to the RO model must contain a standardized disclaimer statement by the CMS. All such documents must be retained for potential audit or review by the CMS

### Where can I find more information about the RO-APM?

The CMMI has a public website for the proposed radiation oncology model [9]. The proposed rule along with other supporting documents can be found on this website. They also hosted an online listening session on the model; transcript and audio recordings are available [10]. 

Additionally, Kavanagh provides an excellent summary of ASTRO’s perspective regarding the history and rationale for the APM [4]. The response letters from ASTRO and ABS provide valuable insight into limitations and criticisms of the proposed rule [5, 6].
